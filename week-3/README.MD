### React Router Quickstart

# React Router Documentation https://reactrouter.com/start/declarative/installation

# Declarative Mode(easiest): enables basic routing features like matching URLs to components, navigating around the app, and providing active states with APIs like <Link>, useNavigate, and useLocation.

# Data Mode(more control, more setup though): By moving route configuration outside of React rendering, Data Mode adds data loading, actions, pending states and more with APIs like loader, action, and useFetcher.

# Framework (don't worry about this one, but it's in the documentation)
# Use this if you're familiar with file based routing.
